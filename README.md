# Dual-channel Graph-level Anomaly Detection Method Based on Multi-Graph Representation Learning

This repository contains the source code for the paper titled "Dual-channel Graph-level Anomaly Detection Method Based on Multi-Graph Representation Learning." The code implements our proposed method for detecting anomalies in graph data using multi-graph representation learning techniques.

## Dataset Directory

The datasets used for experiments are located in the `data/` directory. You can create subdirectories for different datasets, e.g., `data/Datasets/`, and place your dataset files there.

## Model Code Directory

The model implementation can be found in the `model/` directory. The main file, `DCADAnomaly.py`, contains the architecture and training routines for our dual-channel graph-level anomaly detection method. The other .py files are the code for the baseline model.
